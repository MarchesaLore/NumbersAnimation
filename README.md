# Numbers Animation

My goal was to get an animation of a number going from 0 to x

I first tried a few different animations 1 with js and 2 with css
in index.html

then I picked the js one and made 2 examples

1) Animation Once (when visible)
this has 2 blocks of numbers increasing, the first is visible right on the opening of the page and goes right away, the second is activated when you scroll down. The animation is played only once

2) Animation Restart (when visible)
the animation will go from beginning to end but when the numbers are not anymore visible on the screen and then visible again they will get started again, so just go to the page and scroll up and dow and you'll see the animation going again.
